# Linear_Regression
This project is about predict salary of person on basis of years of exeprience
Imported necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, os, seaborn 
Imported dataset from local machine- applied preprocessing techniques ex: head, tail, columns, shape, describe, isnull, info, drop
Exploratory data analysis- used visualization such as - lineplot, boxplot, pairplot, hist, scatterplot
Feature engineering- to remove None, Outliers, use MinMaxScalar and fit those minmax
Train and Test split
Model Building using Linear regression- fit train data, implement slope, intercept, 
Predict test value
predict random value
Evaluate metrics
